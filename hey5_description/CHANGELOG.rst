1.0.0 (2016-09-01)
------------------

0.1.3 (2016-04-25)
------------------
* Fix error on loading stil by Rviz as they seem to be malformed
  Error was
  The STL file 'package://XXXX/meshes/finger_flex_collision.stl' is malformed. According to the binary STL header it should have '108' triangles, but it has too much data for that to be the case.
  Seems to be fixed in upcoming Rviz (not released yet) https://github.com/ros-visualization/rviz/issues/913

* Add hand_grasping_frame
* Contributors: Bence Magyar

0.0.6 (2015-01-15)
------------------
* Update hand inertial properties
  - Inertia tensors for all links except palm are approximately four
  orders of magnitude larger to prevent the Gazebo simulation from
  becoming unstable.
  - Palm mass is lower to take into account that actuator mass is
  specified separately.
